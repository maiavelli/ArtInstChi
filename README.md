# ArtInstChi

## Description

A simple application to illustrate artwork at the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois and provide you with data on each piece specified in the input. 

- Project Motivation: As local Midwesterns, the group found the API on local Art Institute information and artwork fascinating. The museum houses a collection that spans centuries and the globe.
- We built this project as a way of exploring artwork by any general search for ease of use.
